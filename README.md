Farther the distance, higher the damage.  
If you have **Rifleman Aced** and shoot at an enemy from 18.00m away, bonus damage `damage ^ (distance / 18) - damage` will be applied.  
The bonus damage is counted as simple damage, similar to what Graze causes to nearby units.  
It can only be triggered by **sniper rifles**.  
Put the decompressed folder to `mod/`, same as other mods.

Q: How will this mod affect some guns?  
A: It encourages players to snipe targets very far away, since the damage increases rapidly with the distance.

Q: What's the simple damage?  
A: Just pure damage. It does not count towards any weapon, also can't be labeled as a headshot. 

Q: How about the original Rifleman Aced?  
A: Most old upgrades except for the pistol zoom increase are removed.
