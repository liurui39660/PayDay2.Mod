Reduce snipers' concern about ammo.  
Or say, a new logic for old Ammo Efficiency.  
Put the decompressed folder into `mods/`, like most other mods.

The new logic is  
Basic: Getting **2** headshots from at least **18.00m** in less than 6.0 seconds will add **1** bullet to your current weapon's reserved ammo. It can only be triggered by SMGs, ARs or Sniper Rifles in single-shot mode.  
Ace: For SMGs and ARs, the distance requirement is **removed**. For Sniper Rifles, the ammo pickup rate is **halved**, but any **lethal headshot** from at least **18.00m** will add **1** bullet to its reserved ammo.   
Note: "Lethal" means the target is either killed or "inspired" by a nearby Medic.

Q: Why do you write this mod?  
A: This mod is mainly for snipers. Have you ever thought the Vantage Points are completely useless? Now it should be much better. As long as you can one-headshot kill enemies, you will theoretically have infinite ammo. 

Q: How will the halved ammo pickup rate affect some guns?  
A: Mostly, it affects 480-level rifles and M95 (Thanatos). 480-level rifles no longer have the guarantee to always gain 1 bullet from an ammo box. E.g., Nagant. The halved pickup rate (w/ Walk-in Closet) is [0.475, 0.675], which means 1 out of 8 ammo box will contain no bullet for Nagant. For M95, the new pickup rate (w/ Walk-in Closet) is [0.035, 0.44], which means if you don't have Fully Loaded Aced, you can't gain any bullet from ammo boxes, though usually, you can kill any unit with one headshot.

Q: How about 160-level and 246-level rifles?  
A: If you have 0% crit chance, 160-level rifles might be hard to one-headshot kill most units in higher difficulties. 246-levels are slightly better, as they can still one-headshot kill Heavy SWATs in DW+ if you don't have a suppressor attached. You can still use them for practicing, as the ammo pickup rate is still very decent and forgiving.

Q: How about ARs and SMGs?  
A: Though in the Basic version, you only need 2 headshots, the 18m distance requirement makes it not that easy to achieve the reward. But if you equip a high-level sight, it might be able to save you 6 skill points, as the distance requirement is the only difference between Basic and Aced, for ARs and SMGs, of course.

Q: Will changing weapon or switching fire mode interrupt the timer?
A: Unlike the unmodded version, in this mod, the timer only reset when the 6s expires or you gain the reward.

I only did some basic tests, please report in the comment or GitHub issues if you find a potential bug.
