With Fully Loaded Aced, each ammo box always grants a throwable, but has a 3s cooldown.
Of course, cooldown-based throwables are not included.
Throw the decompressed folder to `mod/`, like most other mods.

This mod has a bug that the first pick up after you join a game may not give you a throwable. I can fix this issue, but it needs me to touch more source files, which may make this mod incompatible with other mods. So I plan not to fix it.

Q: Why do you write this mod?
A: Two points.
One, the throwables in the game are too unsustainable. How do you distribute 3 frag grenades (or 6 flashbangs, or some reusable cold weapons) throughout the whole heist (which may last 20min to 40min)? Can those 1600 damage 5m radius explosives (or single-shot non-armor-piercing medieval arms) save your team from collapse? Maybe you want to argue "but flashbang stun cops for 4s and cause additional 5s accuracy debuff"; however, even repairing a drill requires 7.5s (or 10s if you can't spare even 1 skill point). A typical case of me is I bring 6 flashbangs from the beginning of the mission; when it ends (either escape or in custody), it's still 6. Their limited supply significantly restricts their tactical usage.
Two, compared with other tier 4 skills (e.g. magic shout that can penetrate walls and floors), Fully Loaded Aced does not worth it at all. It only give you slightly extra ammo (1.35x -> 1.75x base ammo pick up) plus 1/20 throwable (that 1% increase does not mean 5% -> 6% -> 7%, but 5% -> 5.05% -> 5.1005%). On higher difficulties, hardly can I see people spend 28 points on it. So, it's time to give it a strong buff.

I don't want to call it "XXX Rebalance", so I just give it an intuitive and easy-to-understand title.
Now you need to rethink your skill point distribution. If you want some free grenades and side dish extra ammunition, you need to wipe out another whole tree in exchange for it.

Comments, suggestions and ideas for the thumbnails are welcomed

Mosin Nagant's rate of fire is 60, which means there is exactly 1s between two shots.
