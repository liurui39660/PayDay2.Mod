I think the title is already very clear.  
Graze headshot deal full damage to nearby enemies regardless of the target's current HP. And that headshot does not need to kill the target.  
For body shot, it's still 20%, and if that exceeds the target's current HP, the nearby enemies also receive the full 20% damage.  
Throw the decompressed folder to `'mod/`, like most other mods.

Q: Can you give some examples?  
A: Assume there are two cops, alpha and beta, they are close to each other (<100cm). A player with Graze Aced shoot alpha using a sniper rifle. There are two variables that determine the final damage: hit position (head or body) and lethality (damage can kill alpha or cannot)  
Without this mod, if it's a non-lethal headshot that causes 100 damage to alpha, beta receives 20 damage. If a non-lethal body shot, 100 damage to alpha, beta still receives 20 damage. If a lethal headshot, we further assume alpha only has 50 HP, beta receives 50 damage. If a lethal body shot, beta receives 10 damage. The aced version only takes effect in the third case.  
With this mod, the above four damage values to beta will be 100, 20, 100 and 20, respectively. The aced version takes effect in both the first and the third case.  
Note that, without this mod, if a Medic nearby and "inspires" alpha from death, it's still counted as lethal. With this mod, lethal or not does not matter at all (as the title says).

If you only want one of the two effects of this mod, please leave a comment.
