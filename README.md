Basic: +ammo, +pickup. Ace: 5s arrow/throwable, 5% rocket/recharge.  
Renamed from `Fully Loaded Aced Always Grant A Throwable (3s Cooldown)`, so delete that mod first.  
Throw the decompressed folder to `mods/`, like most other mods.

This mod gives Fully Loaded a buff. Below is the in-game description.

Basic: Your total ammo capacity is increased by **25%**.  
Also, the amount of ammo you gain from ammo boxes is increased by **75%**.  
Note: Does not stack with the perk deck skill "Walk-in Closet".

Ace: You get a regular throwable and an arrow from an ammo box. This can not occur more than once every **5** seconds.  
You gain a **5%** chance to recharge a throwable or get a rocket from an ammo box.  
Note: This effect is triggered after successfully picking up an ammo box. Chances are computed independently.

Q: The in-game description looks a bit weird.  
A: SuperBLT has some issues in parsing macros, use [Localization Macro Replacement](https://modworkshop.net/mod/28831) before they fix it.

I only did some basic tests. Please tell me if there's any inconsistency with the description.
